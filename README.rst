DILImap & ToxPredictor
======================

**DILImap** is a comprehensive toxicogenomics library with RNA-seq data from primary human hepatocytes for 300
compounds, designed to address Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) challenges in drug development.

**ToxPredictor** is a DILI prediction model trained on DILImap. Achieving 89% sensitivity at 100% specificity, it
outperforms traditional methods, accurately identifying DILI risks in withdrawn and idiosyncratic drugs.
